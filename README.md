# MiniPSI

Two private set intersection (PSI) protocols using `arkworks`:

1. The malicious PSI protocol described in the paper ["Compact and Malicious Private Set Intersection for Small Sets"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1159.pdf) by Rosulek and Trieu. Figure 4.
2. The semi-honest PSI protocol described in a [presentation](https://cyber.biu.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15.pdf) by Benny Pinkas. Page 14 on the PDF.

# Testing

Run `cargo test`. The tests incidentally show how the libraries are used.
